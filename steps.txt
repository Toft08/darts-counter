These are steps taken to get github static to work..
Don't fully understand why the build pathbecomes wrong so this is a work around for now.

1. Build 
ng build --configuration production --base-href /darts-counter/ 

2. Copy contents from browser move out to docks and remove browser
cp -r docs/browser/* docs/ && rm -rf docs/browser

3. Send to github
git add -A && git commit -m "" && git push
